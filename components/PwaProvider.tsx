/**
 * Registers the ZkVanguard service worker exactly once per page load.
 *
 * Why a dedicated provider component: registration MUST run client-side (there's
 * no navigator in SSR) and it's called from the root layout, which is a Server
 * Component. Wrapping in a small 'use client' component keeps the layout server-
 * side while still getting the SW mounted on hydration.
 *
 * Fails silently if the browser doesn't support service workers — nothing else
 * on the site depends on the SW being up.
