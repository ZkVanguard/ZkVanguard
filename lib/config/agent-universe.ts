/**
 * Agent asset universe — single source of truth for "which markets do the
 * agents monitor and act on?"
 *
 * Composed from three inputs, in priority order:
 *
 *   1. Pool assets — inherently 4-asset because `community_pool_usdc.move`
 *      hardcodes struct fields `btc_bps / eth_bps / sui_bps / cro_bps`.
 *      Adding a 5th requires a Move upgrade + package redeploy. The names
 *      are read from `parseTargetAllocation`'s return keys so this file
 *      never lies about pool composition.
 *
 *   2. Trader assets — from `lib/config/trader-assets.ts`. The trader has
 *      per-symbol BlueFin invariants (minQty, step) that also can't be
 *      discovered dynamically, so its list is contract-locked too.
 *
 *   3. Dynamic Polymarket universe — `resolveTrackedAssets()` returns the
 *      live 5-min-binary universe (10+ assets typically) when
 *      POLYMARKET_TRACKED_ASSETS=auto, else the static explicit list.
 *
 * Everything else in the agent stack (HedgingAgent directives, Delphi
 * fetches, price-monitor feeds, poly-discover relevance) should call
 * `resolveAgentUniverse()` instead of hardcoding an asset list. The
 * synchronous `AGENT_UNIVERSE_FLOOR` export is available for call sites
 * that can't await.
