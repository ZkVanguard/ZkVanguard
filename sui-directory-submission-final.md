## 5. Project Long Description
> ZkVanguard is a Sui-native, AI-first risk-management platform built on the ASI (Artificial Superintelligence Alliance) stack and centered on a USDC Community Pool deployed on Sui mainnet. Users deposit USDC and receive shares (1 share = 1 USDC); seven autonomous AI agents allocate the pool across BTC (30%), ETH (30%), SUI (25%), and CRO (15%), executing atomic swaps through the Cetus aggregator and trading perpetuals on Bluefin. Rebalancing triggers automatically on 5% drift or 75%+ AI confidence, and sponsored transactions keep the experience gasless.
>
> Every decision is AI-driven and always-on. Crowd-sourced odds from Polymarket and other prediction markets — wisdom-of-crowds signals with measurably high directional accuracy — stream into the Delphi correlation engine, which maps each signal to the pool's composition and emits HEDGE / MONITOR / IGNORE decisions. The Hedging Agent executes those decisions on-chain via Bluefin perpetuals (`bluefin_bridge.move`) and ZK-private commitment hedges before adverse moves materialize.
>
> Seven ASI-powered agents coordinate via a typed message bus with safe-execution guards: Lead, Risk (VaR / Sharpe / liquidation), Hedging, Settlement (gasless), Reporting, PriceMonitor, and SuiPool (NAV + rebalancing).
>
> Sui Move contracts shipped on mainnet: community_pool_usdc, community_pool_timelock, bluefin_bridge, hedge_executor, zk_hedge_commitment, zk_proxy_vault, zk_verifier, payment_router, and rwa_manager — all capability-gated (AdminCap / FeeManagerCap / RebalancerCap / AgentCap).
>
> Sui & Bluefin services: SuiCommunityPoolService, SuiOnChainHedgeService, SuiPrivateHedgeService (stealth addresses + ZK commitments), SuiAutoHedgingAdapter, SuiPortfolioManager, SuiHedgeReconciler, SuiExplorerService, BluefinService (perps SDK), BluefinAggregatorService (multi-DEX quotes & rebalance planner), and BluefinTreasuryService. Sponsored transactions are exposed via `/api/sui/sponsor-gas` and `/api/sui/sponsor-execute`. Coverage: 9-suite, 72/72 E2E pass.
