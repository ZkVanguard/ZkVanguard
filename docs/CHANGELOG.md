## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-04 — Pool wash-trade bleed stopped

### Autonomy — sample-rate + hysteresis

The pool kept bleeding after 3afc3085 shipped the per-asset stale-hedge fix. Deep-dive on the prod ring buffer found two execution-level chop loops. Signal quality wasn't the issue — sample-rate aliasing was.

- **agent-signal-tick confidence gate** (`app/api/cron/agent-signal-tick/route.ts:74`) — was firing `checkAndCloseDrifts` on every direction change including 39%-conf coin-flips. New env `SIGNAL_FLIP_MIN_CONF` (default 55) requires the NEW signal to meet confidence before treating the change as an actionable flip. State write is suppressed on suppressed flips so a noise flip doesn't rewrite the baseline and hide the next real one.
- **agent-signal-tick claim debounce 90s → 15 min** — `Polymarket5MinService` is a 5-minute binary market ("BTC up or down in 5 min"); sampling it every 90s produced 125 flips in 3h ring buffer with 48 at ≥85% conf. Not signal quality — sample-rate aliasing on a coin-flip market. New env `SIGNAL_TICK_INTERVAL_MS` (default 900_000). Matches the effective persistence of the underlying feed. QStash schedule (every 2 min) stays put; excess triggers no-op via claim debounce.
- **Profit-lock zero-risk hysteresis** (`lib/services/sui/cron/profit-lock-guard.ts:120`) — NAV oscillating around the 20% DD threshold triggered a wash-trade loop: sell all spot to USDC at 20% DD, buy back at 19% DD, sell again next tick (~4-6× per day at ~30-50 bps per round-trip). New env `PROFIT_LOCK_HYSTERESIS_PCT` (default 5); once in zero-risk, require drawdown to recover past `PROFIT_LOCK_ZERO_RISK_AT - PROFIT_LOCK_HYSTERESIS_PCT` before easing. `applyProfitLock` accepts `wasInZeroRisk` via existing `profit-lock:zero-since` cron_state key — no new state.
- **Test coverage** — 4 new unit tests in `test/unit/profit-lock-recovery.test.ts` covering enter/exit/no-hold/env-override cases. Bulletproof drawdown stays 10/10.

### Known structural (not code) limits
- At $29 pool NAV, BTC-PERP minQty (0.001 → $73 notional) and ETH-PERP minQty (0.01 → $30 notional) prevent proper hedging. Spot BTC/ETH sit naked-long → any market drop bleeds. Signal accuracy doesn't help when the venue's minQty prevents acting on it. Unblock is lifting the $10K TVL cap so deposits can grow the pool past the minQty gap.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-31 — Full autonomy on, DB slimmed, monster methods cracked

### Autonomy — defense gates now default ON
16-day trader idle streak (2026-07-15 → 2026-07-31) exposed several gaps between "gates exist" and "gates fire". Fixed end-to-end and verified with a real SOL trade opening + closing on venue.

- **envFlagOnByDefault helper** (`lib/utils/env-flag.ts`) — new companion to `envFlag`; returns true unless env is explicitly `0|false|no|off`. Applied to `PORTFOLIO_DRIVER_EXECUTE`, `STALE_HEDGE_AUTO_CLOSE`, `ALERT_RESPONSE_EXECUTE` at every execution + observability site (health/production, platform/risk-overview, admin/config-manifest). `ALERT_RESPONSE_EXECUTE_HALT` stays default OFF per rollout order.
- **Trader exposure cap decoupled** (`app/api/cron/polymarket-edge-trader/route.ts:1315`) — was counting ALL BlueFin positions (including SUI pool dual-leg) toward its own cap. Now measures only the trader's own contribution via KEY_ACTIVE re-read. Pool positions remain visible to BlueFin liquidation math but no longer freeze the trader.
- **Trader exposure cap raised** — default 30 → 60% (`lib/services/trading/trade-quality-gates.ts`) + prod env `TRADE_MAX_TOTAL_NOTIONAL_PCT=250`. Trader leverage raised to `POLYMARKET_EDGE_LEVERAGE=5` (max cap).
- **Autohedge phantom-zero halt guard** (`lib/services/sui/cron/step-8-auto-hedge.ts:101`) — the drawdown-halt no longer trips on `navUsd <= 0`. 2026-07-30 incident: dead SUI public RPC → `computeUsdcNav` returned 0 → halt logic saw "100% below peak $36.27" and paused autohedge for the full UTC day.
- **Phantom-rate detector excludes reconstructed_*** (`app/api/health/production/route.ts` + `alert-response-loop/route.ts`) — `bluefin-db-reconcile` adopts real BlueFin fills with `realized_pnl=0` (legitimately — no fill data at close time). Was flagging real trades as phantom. Now filters `order_id NOT LIKE 'reconstructed_%'`.

### Dashboard — honest UI
- **Always-visible ATH drawdown chip** (`components/dashboard/community-pool/PoolStats.tsx`) — amber ≤-5%, red ≤-15%. Was hidden in 10px subtext on desktop only; mobile users never saw drawdown at all.
- **Normalized stale chip wording** across mobile + desktop breakpoints (was two different strings).
- **Deduplicated card layouts** — extracted `Metric` component; mobile-hero, mobile-strip, desktop grid all render through it.
- **Removed silent SUI 100% fallback** (`components/dashboard/community-pool/mappers.ts`) — was lying when the server didn't return allocations. Now returns all-zeros so callers can render "unavailable" honestly.
- **Honest hedge-count sub-label** — "Active hedges" now says `≥ $1 notional, all sources` (was silently excluding micro-hedges without saying so).

### DB — cleanup + auto-prune
Audit surfaced 32,259 orphaned rows in `cron_state` (13 MB table, mostly stale `poly-momentum:history:*` entries from markets that resolved months ago). One-shot cleanup + code to prevent recurrence.

- **poly-momentum:history:* rows older than 7 days auto-pruned** each poly-discover tick (`lib/services/market-data/poly-discover-tick.ts`). Cleaned 27,399 stale rows one-shot.
- **poly-discover:seenBroadSlugs capped at 2000 items** — was unbounded (1.2 MB blob parsed on every discover tick). Cap = ~10 days of new-market memory.
- **`cron_state` table size 13 MB → 12 MB** post-vacuum (heap freed for reuse).

### Refactor — monster methods cracked
Extractions preserve behavior 1:1; typecheck clean, bulletproof drawdown test stayed 10/10 green throughout.

- **BluefinService** 1632 → 975 LOC (-40%). `openHedge` (435 LOC method) → `bluefin/open-hedge-impl.ts` + `closeHedge` (273 LOC method) → `bluefin/close-hedge-impl.ts`. Both take a `Context` bundle matching the pattern from `bluefin/dry-run-hedge.ts`.
- **llm-provider** 1223 → 1074 LOC. `generateFallbackResponse` (161-LOC keyword switch → canned responses) → `lib/ai/fallback-responses.ts`.
- **polymarket-edge-trader** 1680 → 1638 LOC. `riskGate` lifted to `lib/services/trading/trade-quality-gates.ts` (natural home alongside `exposureCap`, `fundingEdge`, `regretBasedHalt`); now pure — takes leverage/minQty as args.

### Skipped (audit was wrong)
- **HedgingAgent** — my ponytail-audit reported "839-LOC method" but that was a *range* between two grep markers, not a single function. Actual: 10 methods averaging 100 LOC each. Splitting = theater.
- **AutoHedgingService** — audit reported "assessPortfolioRisk 757 LOC"; actual is 101 LOC. Biggest is `assessCommunityPoolRisk` at 332 LOC (one coherent per-chain assessment — long but linear).

### Deferred
- **useCommunityPool 627-LOC handleDeposit callback** — genuine monster, but React state + chain-switching + permit-signing across 4 wallets. Needs a dedicated PR with manual UI testing.

### Deploys this session
- `6217104c` defense stack + gates default ON
- `4c4dd5e3` trader exposure cap decoupled
- `6148ab9f` dashboard honest allocations + Metric + DB prune
- `b947a06b` phantom-rate false positive fix

- `e2e5bd4d` BluefinService open/close extraction
- `67ae070e` llm-provider fallback extraction

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added — 8-gate autonomy defense system
Shipped after a real drawdown revealed that existing autonomy layers (profit-lock, hedgeability clamp, drift-close) were prescriptive — they gated future rebalances but never actively reshaped existing holdings. Each gate defends a specific failure mode; the full stack is verified by `test/integration/pool-drawdown-defense.test.ts` (10/10 green).

- **PortfolioDriver** (`lib/services/sui/PortfolioDriver.ts`) — corrective unwind actions on existing spot/perp holdings; emits `SELL_SPOT_TO_USDC` / `BUY_SPOT_FROM_USDC` / `OPEN_HEDGE` / `CLOSE_HEDGE` given current state + signal + drawdown
- **HedgeFillVerifier** (`lib/services/sui/HedgeFillVerifier.ts`) — post-open `getPositions()` cross-check to catch BlueFin silent-rejects
- **applyHedgeabilityClamp** (`lib/services/sui/cron/allocation.ts`) — spot cap → 0% when perp min-qty unopenable at NAV
- **Symmetric sell trigger** (in PortfolioDriver) — mirror of the buy trigger; opposing signal ≥ 65% reduces allocation
- **StaleHedgeDetector** (`lib/services/sui/StaleHedgeDetector.ts`) — age > 7d + ≥ 2 signal flips + contradicted side → force-close candidate
- **Signal-flip drift-close for spot** (in `app/api/cron/agent-signal-tick/route.ts`) — spot leg unwind on direction flip
- **regret-tracker** (`lib/services/ai/regret-tracker.ts`) — confidence-weighted rolling outcome; scales stake by [0.25, 1.0]
- **alert-response-loop** (`lib/services/alerting/alert-response-loop.ts` + `/api/cron/alert-response-loop`) — 3 KILL/hr → shrink; 24h profit-lock → unwind; phantom rate > 1% → halt

### Env gates
All destructive actions ship behind env flags (default OFF) so operators can log-observe first:
- `PORTFOLIO_DRIVER_EXECUTE=1` — actual SELL/BUY/OPEN/CLOSE actions
- `STALE_HEDGE_AUTO_CLOSE=1` — force-close stale hedges
- `ALERT_RESPONSE_EXECUTE=1` — auto-response actions
- `ALERT_RESPONSE_EXECUTE_HALT=1` — HALT_TRADER / HALT_AUTOHEDGE responses
- `REGRET_TRACKER_DISABLE=1` — default ON in polymarket-edge-trader stake calc

### Changed
- `notifyDiscord` now appends KILL/ERROR/WARN alerts to `cron_state` ring buffer key `alert-log:ring-buffer` (200-entry cap) for alert-response-loop consumption
- `polymarket-edge-trader` stake sizing composes regret multiplier with existing signal-strength multiplier
- `sui-hedge-reconcile` cron runs stale-hedge detection each tick (log-only by default)
- `sui-community-pool` cron invokes PortfolioDriver after profit-lock decision

### New QStash schedule required
The `/api/cron/alert-response-loop` route needs an Upstash schedule (every 15 min) — see [DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md](./DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md) for the `curl` snippet.

### Tests
- New: `test/integration/pool-drawdown-defense.test.ts` — 10 tests, live-read/sandbox-write drawdown replay
- New: `test/unit/portfolio-driver.test.ts` — 10 unit tests locking Gap 1/2/5 invariants
- New: `test/unit/hedge-fill-verifier.test.ts` — 11 unit tests for `verifyFill` polling + `computePhantomRate`
- Regression: 412 pre-existing tests still green

### Post-ship follow-ups landed (2026-07-15 audit)
Deep audit surfaced 8 gaps between the log-only defense and actual execution — all closed:

- **PortfolioDriver execution wired** in `app/api/cron/sui-community-pool/route.ts`. When `PORTFOLIO_DRIVER_EXECUTE=1`:
  - `SELL_SPOT_TO_USDC` actions batched into `replenishAdminUsdc` (reuses existing admin-asset → USDC swap path via BluefinAggregator)
  - `CLOSE_HEDGE` actions call `BluefinService.closeHedge({ symbol })` per hedge
  - `BUY_SPOT_FROM_USDC` / `OPEN_HEDGE` deferred to Step 7 allocation-driven swap (no double execution)
  - Discord posts EXECUTED N/M ratio; failures logged per-action
- **Alert-response `SHRINK_SPOT` / `UNWIND_ALL_SPOT` now execute** — write to `cron_state` key `alert-response:spot-target-risk-cap` (6h TTL). `sui-community-pool` reads this after profit-lock and applies the tighter cap (min of profit-lock + override), then PortfolioDriver unwinds to hit it.
- **Phantom hedge rate on `/api/health/production`** — new `checkPhantomRate()` component uses the bulletproof test's meta-invariant query (closed hedges, notional ≥ $1, `realized_pnl = 0` in last hour). Warn > 1%, down > 5%. Alert-response-loop's phantom-halt rule now has a real data feed.
- **SafeExecutionGuard interface comments** corrected: 30 bps / 4× (matches runtime defaults on lines 85-86).
- **3-asset comments** in `community_pool_usdc.move` header + `sui-community-pool/route.ts` header (last stale "4-asset / CRO" references in shipped code).

### Known follow-ups (documented, operator action)
- QStash schedules for `alert-response-loop` and re-add of `health-monitor` — Upstash-managed; see `DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md` Appendix X for the `curl` snippet.
- `PORTFOLIO_DRIVER_EXECUTE=1` flip in Vercel env after log-observe window (recommended: 24h of `[log-only]` Discord messages first).
